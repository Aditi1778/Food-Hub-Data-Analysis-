# Food-Hub-Data-Analysis-
Project Overview

FoodHub is an online food aggregator that connects customers with multiple restaurants through a single smartphone app. The app facilitates direct online orders, assigns delivery personnel, and enables real-time tracking of food deliveries. FoodHub collects data on customer orders, restaurant demand, and delivery efficiency.

The objective of this project is to analyze FoodHub's order data to gain insights into restaurant demand, customer behavior, and overall business performance. These insights will help FoodHub enhance customer experience, optimize operations, and increase profitability.

Project Objectives

As a Data Scientist at FoodHub, your task is to analyze the order data and answer key business questions, including:

    Which restaurants receive the highest number of orders?

    What are the peak ordering hours?

    How does customer rating vary across different restaurants?

    What is the average order delivery time?

    Are there any trends in food ordering behavior based on location?

    How can FoodHub optimize its delivery service based on past order patterns?

By answering these questions, FoodHub can improve customer satisfaction, optimize restaurant partnerships, and enhance delivery logistics.
Dataset Description

The dataset consists of various attributes related to customer orders, restaurant details, and delivery performance. Key columns include:

    Order_ID - Unique identifier for each order

    Customer_ID - Unique identifier for each customer

    Restaurant_Name - Name of the restaurant from which the order was placed

    Order_Time - Timestamp of the order placement

    Delivery_Time - Timestamp of order delivery

    Delivery_Duration - Time taken for delivery (in minutes)

    Customer_Rating - Rating given by the customer (out of 5)

    Restaurant_Location - Location of the restaurant

    Customer_Location - Location of the customer

Technologies Used

    Programming Language: Python

    Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

    Data Processing: Data Cleaning, Missing Value Handling, Data Transformation

    Data Visualization: Charts and Graphs for insights

    Statistical Analysis: Correlation Analysis, Trend Identification

Project Workflow

    Data Collection & Exploration

        Load the dataset and check for missing values.

        Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure and distribution of the data.

    Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

        Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

        Convert timestamps into appropriate formats for analysis.

    Data Analysis & Insights

        Identify the most popular restaurants based on order count.

        Analyze peak ordering times and busiest days of the week.

        Evaluate customer ratings for different restaurants.

        Measure average delivery duration and identify delays.

        Analyze order trends based on locations.

    Data Visualization

        Use bar charts, line graphs, heatmaps, and scatter plots to present key insights.

    Business Recommendations

        Provide data-driven recommendations to improve restaurant partnerships, delivery efficiency, and customer experience.

Expected Outcomes

    Identify top-performing restaurants and high-demand areas.

    Understand customer preferences and order patterns.

    Optimize FoodHubâ€™s delivery service based on data insights.

    Improve customer satisfaction by addressing common delivery and service issues.
